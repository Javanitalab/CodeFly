These instructions, written in programming languages, allow developers to communicate with computers and create a wide range of applications, from simple scripts to complex software systems.\n\nAt its core, programming involves breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable steps and translating those steps into a series of logical and sequential instructions that a computer can understand and execute. This creative and problem-solving aspect of programming is what makes it both challenging and rewarding.","fileId":"5.html","completion":false}]},{"id":11,"name":"Understanding Variables and Data Types","subjectId":1,"description":null,"lessons":null},{"id":12,"name":"Making The Right Life Decisions using Conditional Statements","subjectId":1,"description":null,"lessons":null},{"id":37,"name":"Cole","subjectId":8,"description":"Vero reiciendis adip","lessons":[{"id":13,"chapterId":37,"chapterName":"Cole","name":"Samuel","description":"Possimus labore con","fileId":"13.html","completion":false}]},{"id":39,"name":"Jayme","subjectId":6,"description":"Et velit voluptas qu","lessons":null},{"id":41,"name":"dont delete thisss ","subjectId":9,"description":"string","lessons":[{"id":15,"chapterId":41,"chapterName":"dont delete thisss ","name":"donet delete this 1","description":"string","fileId":"15.html","completion":false}]}],"error":"","status":200}
